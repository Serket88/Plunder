# Plunder

##  What is Plunder?

Plunder was the final project for a course I took called Programming Studio, where we were tasked with making a web-based game.  While I knew the basics of web design, this was my first experience in anything more complicated than static HTML pages.  Plunder relies on node.js and web sockets for its backend.  It was written using a whole lot of JavaScript I learned on the fly.

##  Who worked on this project?

I was the lead coder for Plunder.  Two other individuals were on my team, but they contributed to less than 5% of the code and primarily handled tasks outside of programming, like reports and playtesting.
